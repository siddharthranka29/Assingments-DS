Welcome to my ExcelR Data Science Assignments Repository!



📊 What is Data Science?

Data Science is a multidisciplinary field that combines statistical techniques, machine learning, and programming to extract insights and knowledge from structured and unstructured data. It plays a pivotal role in solving real-world problems across industries like healthcare, finance, retail, and technology by enabling data-driven decision-making.



➡️ Key components of Data Science include:-

> Data Analysis: Understanding trends and patterns in data.

> Data Visualization: Presenting data insights visually for better comprehension.

> Predictive Modeling: Forecasting outcomes using machine learning models.

> Big Data Technologies: Handling large-scale datasets with tools like Hadoop and Spark.
